System Overview\r\n\r\nThis system is a web-based Bulletin Board System that allows users to create posts and communicate through comments. The most distinctive feature of this system is its snapshot-based history management mechanism that preserves all content revision histories to maintain evidence and verify authenticity in case of disputes among users.\r\n\r\n## 2. Core Requirements\r\n\r\n### 2.1 Evidence Preservation Mechanism\r\n\r\nThe most critical requirement of the system is to thoroughly preserve the revision history of all content (posts and comments). This should be implemented as follows:\r\n\r\n1. **Snapshot-based History Management**:\r\n   - When a post or comment is first created, an initial snapshot is generated\r\n   - Each time content is modified, a new snapshot is additionally created\r\n   - Existing snapshots are never modified or deleted\r\n   - Each snapshot must include information such as content, creation time, IP address, etc.\r\n\r\n2. **Logical Deletion Method**:\r\n   - When posts or comments are deleted, they are not actually removed from the database\r\n   - Instead, a deletion time (deleted_at) is recorded for logical deletion\r\n   - Deleted items should not be visible to general users but should be accessible for administrative purposes\r\n\r\n3. **Modification Verification Elements**:\r\n   - All snapshots must record the author's IP address\r\n   - All actions must have precise timestamps\r\n   - Password verification is required for modification/deletion\r\n\r\n### 2.2 Post Functionality Requirements\r\n\r\n1. **Post Creation**:\r\n   - Users must be able to create posts including title and body\r\n   - Author name and password input are required when creating posts\r\n   - The body should be writable in various formats (HTML, Markdown, plain text, etc.)\r\n   - File attachment functionality must be supported\r\n\r\n2. **Post Viewing**:\r\n   - The post list should display the title of the latest version\r\n   - The detail page should primarily display the latest version of content\r\n   - It should be possible to view previous versions (snapshots) as needed\r\n   - Attached file list and download functionality should be provided\r\n\r\n3. **Post Modification**:\r\n   - Authors can modify posts after password verification\r\n   - Modification creates a new snapshot while preserving existing content\r\n   - Attachments should also be modifiable (add/delete/reorder)\r\n\r\n4. **Post Deletion**:\r\n   - Authors can delete posts after password verification\r\n   - Deletion must be implemented as logical deletion (soft delete)\r\n   - Deleted posts should be excluded from general viewing but accessible for administrative purposes\r\n\r\n### 2.3 Comment Functionality Requirements\r\n\r\n1. **Comment Creation**:\r\n   - Users must be able to create comments on posts\r\n   - Author name and password input are required when creating comments\r\n   - The body should be writable in various formats\r\n   - File attachment functionality must be supported\r\n\r\n2. **Hierarchical Comment Structure**:\r\n   - It should be possible to write replies to comments (nested comments)\r\n   - The hierarchical relationship between replies and original comments should be visually represented\r\n   - The hierarchical structure should support unlimited depth\r\n\r\n3. **Comment Modification**:\r\n   - Authors can modify comments after password verification\r\n   - Modification creates a new snapshot while preserving existing content\r\n   - Attachments should also be modifiable\r\n\r\n4. **Comment Deletion**:\r\n   - Authors can delete comments after password verification\r\n   - Deletion must be implemented as logical deletion\r\n   - Deleted comments should be excluded from general viewing but accessible for administrative purposes\r\n\r\n### 2.4 File Attachment Requirements\r\n\r\n1. **File Upload**:\r\n   - It should be possible to attach files when creating/modifying posts and comments\r\n   - Upload of various file formats should be supported\r\n   - Filenames and extensions should be managed separately (files without extensions should also be processable)\r\n\r\n2. **File Management**:\r\n   - Attached files should be displayed in a specific order (sequence)\r\n   - Users should be able to specify or change the file order\r\n   - Files should be accessible via unique URLs\r\n\r\n3. **File Download**:\r\n   - Users should be able to download attached files\r\n   - Files should be provided with the original filename when downloaded\r\n\r\n## 3.

Conclusion and Implementation Considerations\r\n\r\nThe most prominent feature of this bulletin board system is its mechanism to thoroughly preserve the revision history of all content to maintain evidence and verify authenticity in case of disputes among users. This design considers the risks of disputes that can occur due to the nature of e-communities.\r\n\r\nThe following points should be particularly considered during implementation:\r\n\r\n1. **Data Growth Management**: As data continuously increases due to the snapshot approach, efficient storage and retrieval methods are necessary.\r\n\r\n2. **Performance Optimization**: Methods to quickly retrieve the latest snapshots are needed. Performance should be optimized using view tables and other techniques.\r\n\r\n3. **Security Enhancement**: Sensitive information such as passwords and IP addresses must be managed securely.\r\n\r\n4. **User Experience**: Despite having history management functionality, an intuitive and convenient interface should be provided to general users.\r\n\r\nBased on this requirements analysis report, the development team should be able to implement a highly reliable bulletin board system. The focus should be on building a user-friendly system while achieving the core objectives of evidence preservation and dispute prevention."},"prisma":{"schemas":{},"diagrams":{"Articles":"```mermaid\nerDiagram\n\"attachment_files\" {\n  String id PK\n  String name\n  String extension \"nullable\"\n  String url\n  DateTime created_at\n}\n\"bbs_articles\" {\n  String id PK\n  String writer\n  String password\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime deleted_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"bbs_article_snapshots\" {\n  String id PK\n  String bbs_article_id FK\n  String format\n  String title\n  String body\n  String ip\n  DateTime created_at\n}\n\"bbs_article_snapshot_files\" {\n  String id PK\n  String bbs_article_snapshot_id FK\n  String attachment_file_id FK\n  Int sequence\n}\n\"bbs_article_comments\" {\n  String id PK\n  String bbs_article_id FK\n  String parent_id FK \"nullable\"\n  String writer\n  String password\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime deleted_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"bbs_article_comment_snapshots\" {\n  String id PK\n  String bbs_article_comment_id FK\n  String format\n  String body\n  String ip\n  DateTime created_at\n}\n\"bbs_article_comment_snapshot_files\" {\n  String id PK\n  String bbs_article_comment_snapshot_id FK\n  String attachment_file_id FK\n  Int sequence\n}\n\"bbs_article_snapshots\" }|--|| \"bbs_articles\" : article\n\"bbs_article_snapshot_files\" }o--|| \"bbs_article_snapshots\" : snapshot\n\"bbs_article_snapshot_files\" }o--|| \"attachment_files\" : file\n\"bbs_article_comments\" }o--|| \"bbs_articles\" : article\n\"bbs_article_comments\" }o--o| \"bbs_article_comments\" : parent\n\"bbs_article_comment_snapshots\" }|--|| \"bbs_article_comments\" : comment\n\"bbs_article_comment_snapshot_files\" }o--|| \"bbs_article_comment_snapshots\" : snapshot\n\"bbs_article_comment_snapshot_files\" }o--|| \"attachment_files\" : file\n```"},"document":"# Prisma Markdown\n\n> Generated by [`prisma-markdown`](https://github.com/samchon/prisma-markdown)\n\n- [Articles](#articles)\n\n## Articles\n\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n\"attachment_files\" {\n  String id PK\n  String name\n  String extension \"nullable\"\n  String url\n  DateTime created_at\n}\n\"bbs_articles\" {\n  String id PK\n  String writer\n  String password\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime deleted_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"bbs_article_snapshots\" {\n  String id PK\n  String bbs_article_id FK\n  String format\n  String title\n  String body\n  String ip\n  DateTime created_at\n}\n\"bbs_article_snapshot_files\" {\n  String id PK\n  String bbs_article_snapshot_id FK\n  String attachment_file_id FK\n  Int sequence\n}\n\"bbs_article_comments\" {\n  String id PK\n  String bbs_article_id FK\n  String parent_id FK \"nullable\"\n  String writer\n  String password\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime deleted_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"bbs_article_comment_snapshots\" {\n  String id PK\n  String bbs_article_comment_id FK\n  String format\n  String body\n  String ip\n  DateTime created_at\n}\n\"bbs_article_comment_snapshot_files\" {\n  String id PK\n  String bbs_article_comment_snapshot_id FK\n  String attachment_file_id FK\n  Int sequence\n}\n\"bbs_article_snapshots\" }|--|| \"bbs_articles\" : article\n\"bbs_article_snapshot_files\" }o--|| \"bbs_article_snapshots\" : snapshot\n\"bbs_article_snapshot_files\" }o--|| \"attachment_files\" : file\n\"bbs_article_comments\" }o--|| \"bbs_articles\" : article\n\"bbs_article_comments\" }o--o| \"bbs_article_comments\" : parent\n\"bbs_article_comment_snapshots\" }|--|| \"bbs_article_comments\" : comment\n\"bbs_article_comment_snapshot_files\" }o--|| \"bbs_article_comment_snapshots\" : snapshot\n\"bbs_article_comment_snapshot_files\" }o--|| \"attachment_files\" : file\n```\n\n### `attachment_files`\n\nAttachment File.\n\nEvery attachment files that are managed in current system.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`:\n- `name`: File name, except extension.\n- `extension`\n  > Extension.\n  >\n  > Possible to omit like `README` case.\n- `url`: URL path of the real file.\n- `created_at`: Creation time of file.\n\n### `bbs_articles`\n\nArticle entity.\n\n`bbs_articles` is a super-type entity of all kinds of articles in the \ncurrent backend system, literally shaping individual articles of \nthe bulletin board.\n\nAnd, as you can see, the elements that must inevitably exist in the \narticle, such as the title or the body, do not exist in the `bbs_articles`, \nbut exist in the subsidiary entity, [bbs_article_snapshots](#bbs_article_snapshots), as a \n1: N relationship, which is because a new snapshot record is published \nevery time the article is modified.\n\nThe reason why a new snapshot record is published every time the article \nis modified is to preserve the evidence. Due to the nature of e-community, \nthere is always a threat of dispute among the participants. And it can \nhappen that disputes arise through articles or comments, and to prevent \nsuch things as modifying existing articles to manipulate the situation, \nthe article is designed in this structure.\n\nIn other words, to keep evidence, and prevent fraud.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`:\n- `writer`: Writer's name.\n- `password`: Password for modification.\n- `created_at`: Creation time of article.\n- `deleted_at`\n  > Deletion time of article.\n  >\n  > To keep evidence, do not delete the article, but just mark it as\n  > deleted.\n\n### `bbs_article_snapshots`\n\nSnapshot of article.\n\n`bbs_article_snapshots` is a snapshot entity that contains the contents of\nthe article, as mentioned in [bbs_articles](#bbs_articles), the contents of the \narticle are separated from the article record to keep evidence and prevent \nfraud.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`:\n- `bbs_article_id`: Belong article's [bbs_articles.id](#bbs_articles)\n- `format`\n  > Format of body.\n  >\n  > Same meaning with extension like `html`, `md`, `txt`.\n- `title`: Title of article.\n- `body`: Content body of article.\n- `ip`: IP address of the snapshot writer.\n- `created_at`\n  > Creation time of record.\n  >\n  > It means creation time or update time or article.\n\n### `bbs_article_snapshot_files`\n\nAttachment file of article snapshot.\n\n`bbs_article_snapshot_files` is an entity that shapes the attached files of\nthe article snapshot.\n\n`bbs_article_snapshot_files` is a typical pair relationship table to \nresolve the M: N relationship between [bbs_article_snapshots](#bbs_article_snapshots) and\n[attachment_files](#attachment_files) tables. Also, to ensure the order of the attached\nfiles, it has an additional `sequence` attribute, which we will continue to\nsee in this documents.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`:\n- `bbs_article_snapshot_id`: Belonged snapshot's [bbs_article_snapshots.id](#bbs_article_snapshots)\n- `attachment_file_id`: Belonged file's [attachment_files.id](#attachment_files)\n- `sequence`: Sequence of attachment file in the snapshot.\n\n### `bbs_article_comments`\n\nComment written on an article.\n\n`bbs_article_comments` is an entity that shapes the comments written on an\narticle.\n\nAnd for this comment, as in the previous relationship between \n[bbs_articles](#bbs_articles) and [bbs_article_snapshots](#bbs_article_snapshots), the content body \nof the comment is stored in the sub [bbs_article_comment_snapshots](#bbs_article_comment_snapshots) \ntable for evidentialism, and a new snapshot record is issued every time \nthe comment is modified.\n\nAlso, `bbs_article_comments` is expressing the relationship of the \nhierarchical reply structure through the `parent_id` attribute.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`:\n- `bbs_article_id`: Belonged article's [bbs_articles.id](#bbs_articles)\n- `parent_id`\n  > Parent comment's [bbs_article_comments.id](#bbs_article_comments)\n  >\n  > Used to express the hierarchical reply structure.\n- `writer`: Writer's name.\n- `password`: Password for modification.\n- `created_at`: Creation time of comment.\n- `deleted_at`\n  > Deletion time of comment.\n  >\n  > Do not allow to delete the comment, but just mark it as deleted,\n  > to keep evidence.\n\n### `bbs_article_comment_snapshots`\n\nSnapshot of comment.\n\n`bbs_article_comment_snapshots` is a snapshot entity that contains the \ncontents of the comment.\n\nAs mentioned in [bbs_article_comments](#bbs_article_comments), designed to keep evidence \nand prevent fraud.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`:\n- `bbs_article_comment_id`: Belonged article's [bbs_article_comments.id](#bbs_article_comments)\n- `format`\n  > Format of content body.\n  >\n  > Same meaning with extension like `html`, `md`, `txt`.\n- `body`: Content body of comment.\n- `ip`: IP address of the snapshot writer.\n- `created_at`\n  > Creation time of record.\n  >\n  > It means creation time or update time or comment.\n\n### `bbs_article_comment_snapshot_files`\n\nAttachment file of comment snapshot.\n\n`bbs_article_comment_snapshot_files` is an entity resolving the M:N \nrelationship between [bbs_article_comment_snapshots](#bbs_article_comment_snapshots) and \n[attachment_files](#attachment_files) tables.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`:\n- `bbs_article_comment_snapshot_id`: Belonged

system.\n\nFor reference, it is possible to omit one of file name or extension like \n`.gitignore` or `README` case, but not possible to omit both of them,\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `name`\n  > File name, except extension.\n  >\n  > If there's file `.gitignore`, then its name is an empty string.\n- `extension`\n  > Extension.\n  >\n  > Possible to omit like `README` case.\n- `url`: URL path of the real file.\n- `created_at`: Creation time of record.\n\n### `bbs_articles`\n\nArticle entity.\n\n`bbs_articles` is a super-type entity of all kinds of articles in the \ncurrent shopping mall system, literally shaping individual articles of \nthe bulletin board.\n\nAnd, as you can see, the elements that must inevitably exist in the \narticle, such as the title or the body, do not exist in the `bbs_articles`, \nbut exist in the subsidiary entity, [bbs_article_snapshots](#bbs_article_snapshots), as a \n1: N relationship, which is because a new snapshot record is published \nevery time the article is modified.\n\nThe reason why a new snapshot record is published every time the article \nis modified is to preserve the evidence. Due to the nature of e-commerce, \nthere is always a threat of dispute among the participants. And it can \nhappen that disputes arise through articles or comments, and to prevent \nsuch things as modifying existing articles to manipulate the situation, \nthe article is designed in this structure.\n\nIn other words, to keep evidence, and prevent fraud.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `created_at`: Creation time of article.\n- `deleted_at`\n  > Deletion time of article.\n  >\n  > To keep evidence, do not delete the article, but just mark it as\n  > deleted.\n\n### `bbs_article_snapshots`\n\nSnapshot of article.\n\n`bbs_article_snapshots` is a snapshot entity that contains the contents of\nthe article, as mentioned in [bbs_articles](#bbs_articles), the contents of the \narticle are separated from the article record to keep evidence and prevent \nfraud.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `bbs_article_id`: Belong article's [bbs_articles.id](#bbs_articles)\n- `format`\n  > Format of body.\n  >\n  > Same meaning with extension like `html`, `md`, `txt`.\n- `title`: Title of article.\n- `body`: Content body of article.\n- `created_at`\n  > Creation time of record.\n  >\n  > It means creation time or update time or article.\n\n### `bbs_article_snapshot_files`\n\nAttachment file of article snapshot.\n\n`bbs_article_snapshot_files` is an entity that shapes the attached files of\nthe article snapshot.\n\n`bbs_article_snapshot_files` is a typical pair relationship table to \nresolve the M: N relationship between [bbs_article_snapshots](#bbs_article_snapshots) and\n[attachment_files](#attachment_files) tables. Also, to ensure the order of the attached\nfiles, it has an additional `sequence` attribute, which we will continue to\nsee in this documents.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `bbs_article_snapshot_id`: Belonged snapshot's [bbs_article_snapshots.id](#bbs_article_snapshots)\n- `attachment_file_id`: Belonged file's [attachment_files.id](#attachment_files)\n- `sequence`: Sequence of attachment file in the snapshot.\n\n### `bbs_article_comments`\n\nComment written on an article.\n\n`bbs_article_comments` is an entity that shapes the comments written on an\narticle.\n\nAnd for this comment, as in the previous relationship between \n[bbs_articles](#bbs_articles) and [bbs_article_snapshots](#bbs_article_snapshots), the content body \nof the comment is stored in the sub [bbs_article_comment_snapshots](#bbs_article_comment_snapshots) \ntable for evidentialism, and a new snapshot record is issued every time \nthe comment is modified.\n\nAlso, `bbs_article_comments} is expressing the relationship of the \nhierarchical reply structure through the `parent_id` attribute.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `bbs_article_id`: Belonged article's [bbs_articles.id](#bbs_articles)\n- `parent_id`\n  > Parent comment's [bbs_article_comments.id](#bbs_article_comments)\n  >\n  > Used to express the hierarchical reply structure.\n- `created_at`: Creation time of comment.\n- `deleted_at`\n  > Deletion time of comment.\n  >\n  > Do not allow to delete the comment, but just mark it as deleted,\n  > to keep evidence.\n\n### `bbs_article_comment_snapshots`\n\nSnapshot of comment.\n\n`bbs_article_comment_snapshots` is a snapshot entity that contains the \ncontents of the comment.\n\nAs mentioned in [bbs_article_comments](#bbs_article_comments), designed to keep evidence \nand prevent fraud.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `bbs_article_comment_id`: Belonged article's [bbs_article_comments.id](#bbs_article_comments)\n- `format`\n  > Format of content body.\n  >\n  > Same meaning with extension like `html`, `md`, `txt`.\n- `body`: Content body of comment.\n- `created_at`\n  > Creation time of record.\n  >\n  > It means creation time or update time or comment.\n\n### `bbs_article_comment_snapshot_files`\n\nAttachment file of comment snapshot.\n\n`bbs_article_comment_snapshot_files` is an entity resolving the M:N \nrelationship between [bbs_article_comment_snapshots](#bbs_article_comment_snapshots) and \n[attachment_files](#attachment_files) tables.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `bbs_article_comment_snapshot_id`: Belonged snapshot's [bbs_article_comment_snapshots.id](#bbs_article_comment_snapshots)\n- `attachment_file_id`: Belonged file's [attachment_files.id](#attachment_files)\n- `sequence`\n  > Sequence order.\n  >\n  > Sequence order of the attached file in the belonged snapshot.\n\n## Systematic\n\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n\"shopping_channels\" {\n  String id PK\n  String code UK\n  String name UK\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime updated_at\n  DateTime deleted_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"shopping_channel_categories\" {\n  String id PK\n  String shopping_channel_id FK\n  String parent_id FK \"nullable\"\n  String code\n  String name\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime updated_at\n  DateTime deleted_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"shopping_sections\" {\n  String id PK\n  String code UK\n  String name UK\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime updated_at\n  DateTime deleted_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"shopping_sales\" {\n  String id PK\n  String shopping_section_id FK\n  String shopping_seller_customer_id FK\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime opened_at \"nullable\"\n  DateTime closed_at \"nullable\"\n  DateTime paused_at \"nullable\"\n  DateTime suspended_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"shopping_sale_snapshots\" {\n  String id PK\n  String shopping_sale_id FK\n  DateTime created_at\n}\n\"shopping_sale_snapshot_categories\" {\n  String id PK\n  String shopping_sale_snapshot_id FK\n  String shopping_channel_category_id FK\n  Int sequence\n}\n\"shopping_channel_categories\" }o--|| \"shopping_channels\" : channel\n\"shopping_channel_categories\" }o--o| \"shopping_channel_categories\" : parent\n\"shopping_sales\" }o--|| \"shopping_sections\" : section\n\"shopping_sale_snapshots\" }o--|| \"shopping_sales\" : sale\n\"shopping_sale_snapshot_categories\" }o--|| \"shopping_sale_snapshots\" : snapshot\n\"shopping_sale_snapshot_categories\" }o--|| \"shopping_channel_categories\" : category\n```\n\n### `shopping_channels`\n\nChannel information.\n\n`shopping_channels` is a concept that shapes the distribution channel in \nthe market. Therefore, the difference in the channel in this e-commerce \nsystem means that it is another site or application.\n\nBy the way, if your shopping mall system requires only one channel, then \njust use only one. This concept is designed to be expandable in the future.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `code`: Identifier code.\n- `name`: Name of channel.\n- `created_at`: Creation time of record.\n- `updated_at`: Update time of record.\n- `deleted_at`: Deletion time of record.\n\n### `shopping_channel_categories`\n\nCategory of channel.\n\n`shopping_channel_categories` is a concept that refers to classification \ncategories within a specific channel, and is exactly the same as the concept \ncommonly referred to as \"category\" in shopping malls.\n\nAnd `shopping_channel_categories` is different with \n[shopping_sections](#shopping_sections). [shopping_sections](#shopping_sections) refers to a \"corner\" \nthat is independent spatial information in the offline market, which cannot \nsimultaneously classified in a [sale](#shopping_sales). Besides, \n`shopping_channel_categories` can be classified into multiple categories \nin a [sale](#shopping_sales) simultaneously.\n\nProduct | Section (corner) | Categories\n--------|------------------|--------------------------------------\nBeef  | Butcher corner   | Frozen food, Meat, **Favorite food**\nGrape   | Fruit corner   | Fresh food, **Favorite food**\n\nIn addition, as `shopping_channel_categories` has 1:N self recursive \nrelationship, it is possible to express below hierarchical structures. \nThus, each channel can set their own category classification as they want.\n\n- Food > Meat > Frozen\n- Electronics > Notebook > 15 inches\n- Miscellaneous > Wallet\n\nFurthermore, `shopping_channel_categories` is designed to merge between \nthemselves, so there is no burden to edit the category at any time.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_channel_id`: Belonged channel's [shopping_channels.id](#shopping_channels).\n- `parent_id`\n  > Parent category's [shopping_channel_categories.id](#shopping_channel_categories).\n  >\n  > Only when the category is a subcategory of another one.\n- `code`: Identifier code.\n- `name`: Name of category.\n- `created_at`: Creation time of record.\n- `updated_at`: Updadte time of record.\n- `deleted_at`: Deletion time of record.\n\n### `shopping_sections`\n\nSection information.\n\n`shopping_sections` is a concept that refers to the spatial information \nof the market.\n\nIf we compare the section mentioned here to the offline market, it means \na spatially separated area within the store, such as the \"fruit corner\" \nor \"butcher corner\". Therefore, in the [sale](#shopping_sales) entity, \nit is not possible to classify multiple sections simultaneously, but only \none section can be classified.\n\nBy the way, if your shopping mall system requires only one section, then \njust use only one. This concept is designed to be expandable in the future.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `code`: Identifier code.\n- `name`: Name of section.\n- `created_at`: Creation time of record.\n- `updated_at`: Update time of record.\n- `deleted_at`: Deletion time of record.\n\n## Actors\n\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n\"shopping_customers\" {\n  String id PK\n  String shopping_channel_id FK\n  String shopping_member_id FK \"nullable\"\n  String shopping_external_user_id FK \"nullable\"\n  String shopping_citizen_id FK \"nullable\"\n  String(1024) href\n  String(1024) referrer \"nullable\"\n  String ip\n  DateTime created_at\n}\n\"shopping_external_users\" {\n  String id PK\n  String shopping_channel_id FK\n  String shopping_citizen_id FK \"nullable\"\n  String application\n  String uid\n  String nickname\n  String data \"nullable\"\n  String password\n  DateTime created_at\n}\n\"shopping_citizens\" {\n  String id PK\n  String shopping_channel_id FK \"nullable\"\n  String mobile\n  String name\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime deleted_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"shopping_members\" {\n  String id PK\n  String shopping_channel_id FK\n  String shopping_citizen_id FK \"nullable\"\n  String nickname\n  String password\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime updated_at\n  DateTime withdrawn_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"shopping_member_emails\" {\n  String id PK\n  String shopping_channel_id FK\n  String shopping_member_id FK\n  String value\n  DateTime created_at\n}\n\"shopping_sellers\" {\n  String id PK\n  String shopping_member_id FK,UK\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime deleted_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"shopping_administrators\" {\n  String id PK\n  String shopping_member_id FK,UK\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime deleted_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"shopping_addresses\" {\n  String id PK\n  String mobile\n  String name\n  String country\n  String province\n  String city\n  String department\n  String possession\n  String zip_code\n  String special_note \"nullable\"\n  DateTime created_at\n}\n\"shopping_customers\" }o--o| \"shopping_members\" : member\n\"shopping_customers\" }o--o| \"shopping_external_users\" : external_user\n\"shopping_customers\" }o--o| \"shopping_citizens\" : citizen\n\"shopping_external_users\" }o--o| \"shopping_citizens\" : citizen\n\"shopping_members\" }o--o| \"shopping_citizens\" : citizen\n\"shopping_member_emails\" }o--|| \"shopping_members\" : member\n\"shopping_sellers\" |o--|| \"shopping_members\" : member\n\"shopping_administrators\" |o--|| \"shopping_members\" : member\n```\n\n### `shopping_customers`\n\nCustomer information, but not a person but a **connection** basis.\n\n`shopping_customers` is an entity that literally embodies the information \nof those who participated in the market as customers. By the way, the\n`shopping_Customers` does not mean a person, but a **connection** basis.\nTherefore, even if the same person connects to the shopping mall multiple,\nmultiple records are created in `shopping_customers`.\n\nThe first purpose of this is to track the customer's inflow path in detail, and \nit is for cases where the same person enters as a non-member, puts items in the \n[shopping cart](#shopping_cart_commodities) in advance, and only authenticates \ntheir real name or registers/logs in at the moment of \n[payment](#shopping_order_publishes). It is the second. Lastly, it is \nto accurately track the activities that a person performs at the \nshopping mall in various ways like below.\n\n- Same person comes from an [external service](#shopping_external_users)\n- Same person creates multiple [accounts](#shopping_members)\n- Same person makes a purchase as a non-member with only [real name authentication](#shopping_citizens)\n- Same person acts both [seller](#shopping_sellers) and [admin](#shopping_administrators) at the same time\n\nTherefore, `shopping_customers` can have multiple records with the same \n[shopping_citizens](#shopping_citizens), [shopping_members](#shopping_members), and \n[shopping_external_users](#shopping_external_users). Additionally, if a customer signs up for \nmembership after verifying their real name or signs up for our service \nafter being a user of an external service, all related records are changed \nat once. Therefore, identification and tracking of customers can be done \nvery systematically.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_channel_id`: Belonged channel's [shopping_channels.id](#shopping_channels)\n- `shopping_member_id`: Belonged member's [shopping_members.id](#shopping_members)\n- `shopping_external_user_id`: Belonged external service user's [shopping_external_users.id](#shopping_external_users)\n- `shopping_citizen_id`: Belonged citizen's [shopping_citizens.id](#shopping_citizens)\n- `href`\n  > Connection URL.\n  >\n  > [window.location.href](#window)\n- `referrer`\n  > Referrer URL.\n  >\n  > [window.document.referrer](#window)\n- `ip`: IP address,\n- `created_at`\n  > Creation time of record.\n  >\n  > It means the time when the customer connected to the shopping mall.\n\n### `shopping_external_users`\n\nExternal user information.\n\n`shopping_external_users` is an entity dsigned for when this system needs \nto connect with external services and welcome their users as customers of \nthis service.\n\nFor reference, customers who connect from an external service must have \nthis record, and the external service user is identified through the two \nattributes `application` and `uid`. If a customer connected from an \nexternal service completes [real-name authentication](#shopping_citizens) \nfrom this service, each time the external service user reconnects to this \nservice and issues a new [customer](#shopping_customers) authentication \ntoken, [real-name authentication](#shopping_citizens) begins with \ncompleted.\n\nAnd `password` is the password issued to the user by the external service \nsystem (the so-called permanent user authentication token), and is never \nthe actual user password. However, for customers who entered the same \n`application` and `uid` as the current external system user, this is to \ndetermine whether to view this as a correct external system user or a \nviolation.\n\nIn addition, additional information received from external services can \nbe recorded in the `data` field in JSON format.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_channel_id`: Belonged channel's [shopping_channels.id](#shopping_channels)\n- `shopping_citizen_id`: Belonged citizen's [shopping_citizens.id](#shopping_citizens)\n- `application`\n  > Identifier code of the external service.\n  >\n  > It can be same with [shopping_channels.code](#shopping_channels) in common.\n- `uid`: Identifier key of external user from the external system.\n- `nickname`: Nickname of external user in the external system.\n- `data`: Additional information about external user from the external system.\n- `password`\n  > Password of external user from the external system.\n  >\n  > This is a password issued to the user by an external service, and is\n  > by no means the actual user password.

However, \nthe situation is different overseas, so in reality, `mobile` attributes \nare the most important, and identification of individual users is also \ndone based on this mobile.\n\nOf course, real name and mobile phone authentication information are \nencrypted and stored.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_channel_id`\n  > Belonged channel's [shopping_channels.id](#shopping_channels)\n  >\n  > This is to manage personal information separately for each channel,\n  > and also to recognize cases where the same citizen is authenticated\n  > through different channels.\n- `mobile`: Mobile phone number.\n- `name`: Real name, or equivalent name identifiable.\n- `created_at`\n  > Creation time of record.\n  >\n  > In other words, the 1st time of citizen activation.\n- `deleted_at`: Deletion time of record.\n\n### `shopping_members`\n\nMember Account.\n\n`shopping_members` is an entity that symbolizes the case when a user \nsigns up as a member of this system.\n\nIn addition, `shopping_members` itself is a supertype entity, forming \nand managing subtypes for various types of members. However, \n[shopping_customers](#shopping_customers) are an exception, and due to the nature of \ntheir records being created on a per-connection basis, they are not \ndivided into separate subtype entities when they sign up for membership.\n\nFor reference, `shopping_members` allows multiple subtypes. Therefore, \nit is also possible for a [citizen](#shopping_citizens) to be sometimes \na [customer](#shopping_customers), sometimes a \n[seller](#shopping_sellers), sometimes an \n[administrator](#shopping_administrators), and so on. \n\nOf course, this is according to system theory, and it is unclear what \nthe planning will be like.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_channel_id`: Belonged channel's [shopping_channels.id](#shopping_channels)\n- `shopping_citizen_id`: Belonged citizen's [shopping_citizens.id](#shopping_citizens)\n- `nickname`: Nickname.\n- `password`: Password for log-in.\n- `created_at`\n  > Creation time of record.\n  >\n  > In other words, the joining time.\n- `updated_at`: Update time of record.\n- `withdrawn_at`: Deletion time of record.\n\n### `shopping_member_emails`\n\nEmail address of member.\n\nThis system allows multiple email addresses to be registered for one\n[member](#shopping_members).

And the \nmain information of the sale is recorded in the sub \n[shopping_sale_snapshots](#shopping_sale_snapshots), not in the main `shopping_sales`. \nWhen a seller changes a previously registered item, the existing \n`shopping_sales` record is not changed, but a new snapshot record is \ncreated.\n\nThis is to preserve the [customer](#shopping_customers)'s \n[purchase history](#shopping_orders) flawlessly after the customer \npurchases a specific item, even if the seller changes the components or \nprice of the item. It is also intended to support sellers in so-called \nA/B testing, which involves changing components or prices and measuring \nthe performance in each case.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_section_id`: Belonged section's [shopping_sections.id](#shopping_sections)\n- `shopping_seller_customer_id`: Belonged seller's [shopping_customers.id](#shopping_customers)\n- `created_at`\n  > Creation time of record.\n  >\n  > Note that, this property is different with `opened_at`, which means\n  > the opening time of sale.\n- `opened_at`\n  > Opening time of sale.\n  >\n  > If `null` value assigned, it means not opened yet.\n- `closed_at`\n  > Closing time of sale.\n  >\n  > If `null` value assigned, the sale is forever.\n- `paused_at`\n  > Paused time.\n  >\n  > The time when seller paused the sale in some reason.\n  >\n  > [Customers](#shopping_customers) still can see the sale in list\n  > and detail page, but a label \"The sale is paused for a while by seller\"\n  > be attached.\n- `suspended_at`\n  > Suspended time.\n  >\n  > The time when seller suspended the sale in some reason.\n  >\n  > [Customers](#shopping_customers) can't see the sale in list and\n  > detail page.

This is the case with so-called \"bundled products\".\n\n- Bundle from regular product (Macbook Set)\n- main body\n- keyboard\n- mouse\n- Apple Care (Free A/S Voucher)\n\nAnd again, `shopping_sale_snapshot_units` does not in itself refer to \nthe final [stock](#shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_stocks) that the \ncustomer will purchase. \nThe [final stock](#shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_stocks) can be \nfound only after selecting all given \n[options](#shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_options) and their \n[candidate](#shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_option_candidates) values.\n\nFor example, even if you buy a Macbook, the \n[final stocks](#shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_stocks) are determined \nonly after selecting all the \n[options](#shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_options) (CPU / RAM / SSD), etc.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_sale_snapshot_id`: Belonged snapshot's [shopping_sale_snapshots.id](#shopping_sale_snapshots)\n- `name`: Representative name of the unit.\n- `primary`\n  > Whether the unit is primary or not.\n  >\n  > Just a labeling value.\n- `required`\n  > Whether the unit is required or not.\n  >\n  > When the unit is required, the customer must select the unit.

Cart.\n\n`shopping_carts` is literally a space where \n[customer](#shopping_customers) temporarily stores products before\n[purchase](#shopping_orders).\n\nBy the way, it is possible for [sellers](#shopping_sellers) or \n[administrators](#shopping_administrators) to compose a shopping cart.\nOf course, the reason why they can compose a shopping cart is not for\n[purchasing](#shopping_orders), but for providing a shopping cart template\nto [customers](#shopping_customers).\n\nSale | Cart | Order\n-----|------|------\nx | [shopping_carts](#shopping_carts)

cart.\n\n`shopping_cart_commodities` is an entity that represents a \n[snapshot](#shopping_sale_snapshots) of the items that \n[customer](#shopping_customers) has placed into his \n[shopping cart](#shopping_carts) with a \n[purchase](#shopping_orders) in mind. And if the customer continues \nthis into an actual [order](#shopping_orders) in the future, \n`shopping_cart_commodities` be changed to [shopping_order_goods](#shopping_order_goods).\n\nAnd while adding a sale snapshot to the shopping cart, the customer \ninevitably selects specific [units](#shopping_sale_snapshot_units) and \n[final stocks](#shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_stocks) within the listing \nsnapshot. Information about these units and stocks is recorded in the \nsubsidiary entity [shopping_cart_commodity_stocks](#shopping_cart_commodity_stocks). Also, there is an \nattribute `volume` that indicates how many sets of snapshots of the \ntarget commodity will be purchased. This \"volume\" is a value that will be \nmultiplied by [shopping_cart_commodity_stocks.quantity](#shopping_cart_commodity_stocks), the quantity \nfor each component.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_cart_id`: Belonged cart's [shopping_carts.id](#shopping_carts)\n- `shopping_sale_snapshot_id`: Target snapshot's [shopping_sale_snapshots.id](#shopping_sale_snapshots)\n- `volume`\n  > Volume count.\n  >\n  > The value multiplied to [shopping_cart_commodity_stocks.quantity](#shopping_cart_commodity_stocks).\n- `created_at`: Creation time of record.\n- `deleted_at`: Deletion time of record.\n- `published`\n  > Whether be published or not.\n  >\n  > Is current commodity ordered and be paid?\n  >\n  > Until purchase the commodity, the commodity can be reused to create new\n  > cart commodity.

The final quantity \nactually purchased can be multiplied by the \n[shopping_cart_commodities.volume](#shopping_cart_commodities) value of the parent entity.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_cart_commodity_id`: Belonged commodity's [shopping_cart_commodities.id](#shopping_cart_commodities)\n- `shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_id`: Target unit's [shopping_sale_snapshot_units.id](#shopping_sale_snapshot_units)\n- `shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_stock_id`: Target final stock's [shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_stocks.id](#shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_stocks)\n- `quantity`: Quantity count.\n- `sequence`: Sequence order in belonged cart commodity.\n\n### `shopping_cart_commodity_stock_choices`\n\nOption choice information for the final stock added to the shopping cart.\n\n`shopping_cart_commodity_stock_choices` is a subsidiary entity of \n[shopping_cart_commodity_stocks](#shopping_cart_commodity_stocks). It records which \n[options](#shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_options) the customer \nspecifically used while putting a specific \n[unit](#shopping_sale_snapshot_units) and specific \n[stock](#shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_stocks) of the \n[sale snapshot](#shopping_sale_snapshots) in the shopping cart, and \nwhich [candidate values](#shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_option_candidates) \nwere selected or written within the shopping cart.\n\nTherefore, `shopping_cart_commodity_stock_choices` has reference properties \nand predicate properties for candidate values in addition to references \nto options. If the `type` of target option is \"select\", enter the \ncandidate value selected by the customer. Otherwise, enter the value \nwritten by the customer.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_cart_commodity_stock_id`: Belonged cart-commodity-stock's [shopping_cart_commodity_stocks.id](#shopping_cart_commodity_stocks)\n- `shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_option_id`: Target option's

information.\n\n`shopping_orders` is an entity that embodies \n[customer](#shopping_customers)'s order application information. \nHowever, please note that at this time, you are still at the \n\"order application\" stage and not the \"order confirmation\" stage.\n\nAnd as soon as a customer applies for an order, all \n[commodities](#shopping_cart_commodities) in the target shopping cart are \npromoted to [shopping_order_goods](#shopping_order_goods), and those \n[shopping_order_goods](#shopping_order_goods) records are created under this \n`shopping_orders`. \n\nOf course, not all commodities in the target shopping cart become \n[shopping_order_goods](#shopping_order_goods), but only those selected by the customer \nbecome the [shopping_order_goods](#shopping_order_goods).\n\nSale | Cart | Order\n-----|------|------\nx | [shopping_carts](#shopping_carts) |

This is \nbecause there are some cases where you put 3 books in your shopping cart \nand then change them to 4 during the actual order application process. \nThis is to increase the reusability of the shopping cart by changing the \nvolume attribute of the current entity rather than directly changing the \nshopping_cart_commodities information.\n\nIn addition, `shopping_order_goods` becomes the most basic unit for \nthe post-order process, that is, after service (A/S). For example, \nafter receiving a customer's product, confirming the order is recorded \nin the `confirmed_at` attribute. Additionally, `shopping_order_goods` is \nthe unit in which customers issue issues or request exchanges or refunds \nfor ordered products.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_order_id`: Belonged order's [shopping_orders.id](#shopping_orders)\n- `shopping_cart_commodity_id`: Belonged cart commodity's [shopping_cart_commodities.id](#shopping_cart_commodities)\n- `shopping_seller_id`\n  > Belonged seller's [shopping_sellers.id](#shopping_sellers)\n  >\n  > It can be computed by referencing related [shopping_sales](#shopping_sales),\n  > but denormalized for performance reason.\n- `volume`\n  > Volume count.\n  >\n  > The value multiplied to [shopping_cart_commodity_stocks.quantity](#shopping_cart_commodity_stocks).\n  > It's purpose is exactly same with [shopping_cart_commodities.volume](#shopping_cart_commodities),\n  > but rewritten because the [shopping_cart_commodities](#shopping_cart_commodities) records are\n  > reusable until payment.\n- `sequence`: Sequence order(?) in belonged order.\n- `confirmed_at`\n  > Confirmation time of order good.\n  >\n  > When be confirmed, customer can't request refund or exchange.\n  >\n  > The confirmation be accomplished by following cases.\n  >\n  > - Customer does it directly.\n  > - 14 days after the delivery.\n\n### `shopping_order_publishes`\n\nOrder completion and payment information.\n\n`shopping_order_publishes` is an entity that embodies the series of \nprocesses in which a customer pays for his or her \n[order](#shopping_orders), thereby completing the order. And only after \nthe order is completed, can the seller recognize that the customer has \npurchased his product.\n\nBy the way, please note that just because the `shopping_order_publishes` \nrecord exists, it does not mean that the payment has been completed. \nOf course, with \"credit cards\" and \"Google Pay\", payment application and \npayment occur at the same time. However, there are some cases where \npayment is made after the payment application, such as \"bank transfer\" or \n\"virtual account payment\". Therefore, to see the completion of payment, \nbe sure to check the `paid_at` property.\n\nIn addition, even after payment has been made, there may be cases where \nit is suddenly cancelled, so please be aware of this as well.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_order_id`: Belonged order's [shopping_orders.id](#shopping_orders)\n- `shopping_address_id`\n  > Target address' [shopping_addresses.id](#shopping_addresses)\n  >\n  > The place to receive the goods.

If this property is `null`, the payment has not been\n  > completed yet.\n- `cancelled_at`: The time when the payment was cancelled or reverted.\n\n### `shopping_deliveries`\n\nDelivery information.\n\nWhen delivering [goods](#shopping_order_goods) to \n[customer](#shopping_customers), [seller](#shopping_selleres) can deliver \nmultiple [stocks](#shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_stocks), goods at once. Also, \nit is possible to deliver a stock or good in multiple times due to physical \nrestriction like volume or weight problem.\n\nAs you can see from above, the relationship between delivery with \n[order](#shopping_orders) (or good) is not 1: 1 or N: 1, but M: N. Entity \n`shopping_deliveries` has been designed to represent such relationship, by \nreferencing target stocks or goods through subsidiary entity \n[shopping_delivery_pieces](#shopping_delivery_pieces).\n\nAlso, delivery does not end with only one step. It has multiple processes like\nmanufacturing, planning, shipping and delivering. Those steps are represented by\nanother subsidiary entity [shopping_delivery_journeys](#shopping_delivery_journeys).\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_seller_customer_id`: Belonged seller's [shopping_sellers.id](#shopping_sellers)\n- `created_at`: Creation time of record.\n- `deleted_at`: Deletion time of record.\n\n### `shopping_delivery_pieces`\n\nWhich stocks are delivered.\n\n`shopping_delivery_pieces` is a subsidiary entity of [shopping_deliveries](#shopping_deliveries), \ndescribing how much quantity is delivered for each \n[stock](#shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_stocks) in [shopping_orders](#shopping_orders).\n\nFor reference, as an order can be delivered in multiple times due to volume or \nweight problem, it is possible to have multiple `shopping_delivery_pieces` records \nfor a single stock.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_delivery_id`: Belonged delivery's [shopping_deliveries.id](#shopping_deliveries)\n- `shopping_order_publish_id`: Target order-publish'es [shopping_order_publishes.id](#shopping_order_publishes)\n- `shopping_order_good_id`: Target good's [shopping_order_goods.id](#shopping_order_goods)\n- `shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_stock_id`: Target stock's [shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_stocks.id](#shopping_sale_snapshot_unit_stocks)\n- `quantity`\n  > Quantity count.\n  >\n  > It can be precision value to express split shipping.\n- `sequence`: Sequence order in belonged delivery.\n\n### `shopping_delivery_shippers`\n\nShipper information of delivery.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_delivery_id`: Belonged delivery's [shopping_deliveries.id](#shopping_deliveries)\n- `mobile`: Mobile number of shipper.\n- `name`: Name of shipper.\n- `company`: Company of shipper.\n- `created_at`:\n\n### `shopping_delivery_journeys`\n\nJourney of delivery.\n\n`shopping_delivery_journeys` is a subsidiary entity of [shopping_deliveries](#shopping_deliveries), \ndescribing each journey of the delivery.

Please keep in mind that this is a different \nconcept from [shopping_coupon_tickets](#shopping_coupon_tickets), which refers to the issuance \nof a discount coupon, or [shopping_coupon_ticket_payments](#shopping_coupon_ticket_payments), which \nrefers to its payment.\n\nAdditionally, discount coupons are applied on an \n[order-by-order](#shopping_orders) basis, but each has its own unique \nrestrictions. For example, a coupon with \n[shopping_coupon_seller_criterias](#shopping_coupon_seller_criterias) may or may not be used only for \n[snapshots](#shopping_sale_snapshots) of listings registered by the \n[seller](#shopping_sellers). Also, there are restrictions such as \nminimum amount restrictions for using discount coupons and maximum discount \namount limits.\n\nIn addition, you can set whether to issue discount coupons publicly or give \nthem only to people who know the specific issuing code. In addition, there \nare restrictions such as issued discount coupons having an expiration date \nor being issued only to customers who came in through a \n[specific funnel](#shopping_coupon_funnel_criterias).\n\nFor more information, please refer to the properties below and the \nsubsidiary entities described later.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_customer_id`: Belonged administrator or seller's [shopping_customers.id](#shopping_customers)\n- `actor_type`\n  > Type of the coupon creator.\n  >\n  > - administrator\n  > - seller\n- `name`: Reprensentative name of coupon.\n- `access`\n  > Access level of coupon.\n  >\n  > - `public`: possible to find from public API\n  > - `private`: unable to find from public API\n  > - arbitrarily assigned by the seller or administrator\n  > - issued from one-time link\n- `exclusive`\n  > Exclusivity or not.\n  >\n  > An exclusive discount coupon refers to a discount coupon that has an\n  > exclusive relationship with other discount coupons and can only be used\n  > alone.

All \nsubtype entities that wish to impose constraints on the reference unit of \na discount coupon were created by inheriting this. For example, the \n[shopping_coupon_section_criterias](#shopping_coupon_section_criterias) entity, designed to limit \napplication to a specific [section](#shopping_sections), inherits this \nentity `shopping_coupon_criterias`.\n\nIn addition, constraints on reference units can be specified through the \n`direction` property to proceed as an inclusion condition or, conversely, \nas an exclusion condition. If the direction value is \"include\", the coupon \nis applicable only to the reference object. Conversely, if the direction \nvalue is \"exclude\", it is a coupon that cannot be applied to the reference \nobject.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_coupon_id`: Belonged coupon's [shopping_coupons.id](#shopping_coupons)\n- `type`\n  > Type of criteria.\n  >\n  > It means which subtype being used.\n- `direction`\n  > Direction of criteria.\n  >\n  > - include\n  > - exclude\n- `sequence`: Sequence order in belonged coupon.\n\n### `shopping_coupon_section_criterias`\n\nConditions for sections of discount coupons.\n\n`shopping_coupon_section_criterias` is a subtype entity of \n[shopping_coupon_criterias](#shopping_coupon_criterias) and is used when setting conditions for \na specific [section](#shopping_sections).\n\nIf the [shopping_coupon_criterias.direction](#shopping_coupon_criterias) value is \"include\", \nthe coupon can only be used for that section. Conversely, if it is \n\"exclude\", the coupon cannot be used. And if there are multiple \n`shopping_coupon_section_criterias` records within one coupon, conditions \nare applied on a bundle basis. Coupons may or may not be applicable to \neligible sections.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_section_id`: Target section's [shopping_coupon_criterias.id](#shopping_coupon_criterias)\n\n### `shopping_coupon_seller_criterias`\n\nConditions for sellers of discount coupons.\n\n`shopping_coupon_seller_criterias` is a subtype entity of \n[shopping_coupon_criterias](#shopping_coupon_criterias) and is used when setting conditions for \na specific [seller](#shopping_sellers).\n\nIf the [shopping_coupon_criterias.direction](#shopping_coupon_criterias) value is \"include\", the \ncoupon can only be used for that seller. Conversely, if it is \"exclude\", \nthe coupon cannot be used.\n\nAnd if there are multiple `shopping_coupon_seller_criterias` records within \none coupon, conditions are applied on a bundle basis.

Of course, it doesn't matter if you \nuse the discount coupon for your order within the deadline.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_customer_id`: Belonged customer's [shopping_customers.id](#shopping_customers)\n- `shopping_coupon_id`: Belonged coupon's [shopping_coupons.id](#shopping_coupons)\n- `shopping_coupon_disposable_id`\n  > Belonged disposable's [shopping_coupon_disposables.id](#shopping_coupon_disposables)\n  >\n  > Only when current ticket be issued from one-time code.\n- `created_at`: Creation time of record.\n- `expired_at`: Expiration time of ticket.\n\n### `shopping_coupon_ticket_payments`\n\nDiscount coupon ticket payment details.\n\n`shopping_coupon_ticket_payments` is an entity that embodies the payment \ninformation for the [order](#shoppiing_orders) of  \n[shopping_coupon_tickets](#shopping_coupon_tickets), and is used when a consumer uses the \ndiscount coupon ticket he or she was issued to order and has the payment \namount deducted.\n\nAnd since [shopping_orders](#shopping_orders) itself is not an entity used in situations \nwhere an order is completed, but rather an entity designed to express an \norder request, the creation of this `shopping_coupon_ticket_payments` record \ndoes not actually mean that the attached ticket disappears. Until the \n[customer](#shopping_customers) \n[completes the payment](#shopping_order_publishes) and \nconfirms the order, the ticket can be understood as a kind of deposit.\n\nAdditionally, this record can be deleted by the customer reversing the \npayment of the ticket, but it can also be deleted when the attribution \norder itself is cancelled.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_coupon_ticket_id`: Belonged ticket's [shopping_coupon_tickets.id](#shopping_coupon_tickets)\n- `shopping_order_id`: Target order's [shopping_orders.id](#shopping_orders)\n- `sequence`: Sequence order(?) in belonged order.\n- `created_at`: Creation time of record.\n- `deleted_at`\n  > Deletion time of record.\n  >\n  > In other words, it means that the target order be erased or payment\n  > be cancelled.\n\n### `shopping_coupon_disposables`\n\nDiscount coupon issuance code management.\n\nIf a [discount coupon](#shopping_coupons) is not public and anyone can \nreceive the ticket, but can only be received by entering a specific \npassword (one-time code), use this `shopping_coupon_disposables` entity.\n\nI repeat again, the code code is \"one-time use\". In other words, if any of \nthe customers enters the code, the code is discarded when the ticket \nissuance to the customer is completed. Therefore, if you want to issue \ntickets multiple times using a discount coupon as a secret code, the \nissuing code must also be supported by the corresponding quantity.\n\nProperties as follows:\n\n- `id`: Primary Key.\n- `shopping_coupon_id`: Belonged coupon's [shopping_coupons.id](#shopping_coupons)\n- `code`\n  > Identifier code.\n  >\n  > Another word, one-time password for issuance.\n- `created_at`: Creation time of record.\n- `expired_at`: Expired time of record.\n\n## Coins\n\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n\"shopping_deposits\" {\n  String id PK\n  String code UK\n  String source\n  Int direction\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime deleted_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"shopping_deposit_histories\" {\n  String id PK\n  String shopping_deposit_id FK\n  String shopping_citizen_id FK\n  String source_id\n  Float value\n  Float balance\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime cancelled_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"shopping_deposit_charges\" {\n  String id PK\n  String shopping_customer_id FK\n  Float value\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime deleted_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"shopping_deposit_charge_publishes\" {\n  String id PK\n  String shopping_deposit_charge_id FK,UK\n  String password \"nullable\"\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime paid_at \"nullable\"\n  DateTime cancelled_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"shopping_mileages\" {\n  String id PK\n  String code UK\n  String source\n  Int direction\n  Float value \"nullable\"\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime deleted_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"shopping_mileage_donations\" {\n  String id PK\n  String shopping_admin_customer_id FK\n  String shopping_citizen_id FK\n  Float value\n  String reason\n  DateTime created_at\n}\n\"shopping_mileage_histories\" {\n  String id PK\n  String shopping_mileage_id FK\n  String shopping_citizen_id FK\n  String source_id\n  Float value\n  Float balance\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime cancelled_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"shopping_customers\" {\n  String id PK\n  String shopping_channel_id FK\n  String shopping_member_id FK \"nullable\"\n  String shopping_external_user_id FK \"nullable\"\n  String shopping_citizen_id FK \"nullable\"\n  String(1024) href\n  String(1024) referrer \"nullable\"\n  String ip\n  DateTime created_at\n}\n\"shopping_citizens\" {\n  String id PK\n  String shopping_channel_id FK \"nullable\"\n  String mobile\n  String name\n  DateTime created_at\n  DateTime deleted_at \"nullable\"\n}\n\"shopping_deposit_histories\" }o--|| \"shopping_deposits\" : deposit\n\"shopping_deposit_histories\" }o--|| \"shopping_citizens\" : citizen\n\"shopping_deposit_charges\" }o--|| \"shopping_customers\" : customer\n\"shopping_deposit_charge_publishes\" |o--|| \"shopping_deposit_charges\" : charge\n\"shopping_mileage_donations\" }o--|| \"shopping_customers\" : adminCustomer\n\"shopping_mileage_donations\" }o--|| \"shopping_citizens\" : citizen\n\"shopping_mileage_histories\" }o--|| \"shopping_mileages\" : mileage\n\"shopping_mileage_histories\" }o--|| \"shopping_citizens\" : citizen\n\"shopping_customers\" }o--o| \"shopping_citizens\" : citizen\n```\n\n### `shopping_deposits`\n\nMeta information of the deposit.\n\n`shopping_deposits` is an entity that embodies the specifications for \nincomes and outcomes of deposit at a shopping mall.
