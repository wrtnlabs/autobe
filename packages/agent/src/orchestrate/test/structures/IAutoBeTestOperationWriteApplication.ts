     * AI performs a thorough review of the draft implementation for:
     *
     * **1. FIX - Improve existing code:**
     *
     * **Compilation & Syntax:**
     *
     * - TypeScript compilation errors and type mismatches
     * - Syntax errors and missing semicolons/brackets
     * - Correct function signatures and parameter types
     *
     * **Framework Compliance:**
     *
     * - @nestia/e2e framework conventions adherence
     * - Proper API SDK function calling patterns
     * - Correct use of typia.assert() and TestValidator functions
     *
     * **Business Logic & Test Coverage:**
     *
     * - Complete workflow implementation (authentication → data setup → main test
     *   → validation)
     * - Realistic business scenarios and user journeys
     * - Edge case handling and error condition testing
     * - Proper data dependencies and cleanup procedures
     *
     * **2. DELETE - Remove prohibited code entirely:**
     *
     * **🚨 TYPE ERROR TESTING - DELETE IMMEDIATELY 🚨**
     *
     * - DELETE any code using `as any` to send wrong types
     * - DELETE any intentional type mismatches for "testing"
     * - DELETE any missing required fields testing
     * - DELETE tests that contradict compilation requirements
     *
     * **Code Quality & Security:**
     *
     * - Type safety violations (any, @ts-ignore, etc.) - DELETE if found
     * - Variable naming and code organization - FIX if needed
     * - Performance considerations and resource management
     * - Security best practices in test data generation
     *
     * Workflow: Draft code → Systematic analysis → FIX or DELETE decisions
     *
     * The review must identify concrete issues with line-by-line feedback and
     * provide actionable solutions (FIX) or deletion instructions (DELETE) for
     * each problem discovered.
     *
     * **DO NOT FIX TYPE ERROR TESTS - DELETE THEM COMPLETELY**

     * implementation, ready for production deployment. When the draft code is
     * already perfect with no issues found during review, this value can be
     * null, indicating no revisions were necessary.
     *
     * **🚨 CRITICAL: APPLY ALL FIXES AND DELETIONS FROM REVIEW 🚨**
     *
     * - FIX all correctable issues identified in review
     * - DELETE all prohibited code identified in review
     * - If review found type error tests, they MUST be deleted in final
     * - If review found code to DELETE, final MUST be different from draft
     * - If review finds NO issues requiring changes, set to null
     *
     * All identified issues must be resolved, and the code must meet the
     * highest quality standards. A null value indicates the draft code already
     * meets all requirements without modification.
     *
     * Workflow: Review feedback → Apply FIXES → Apply DELETIONS →
     * Production-ready implementation (or null if no changes needed)
     *
     * This is the ultimate deliverable that will be used in the actual test
     * suite when provided, otherwise the draft is used as-is.
